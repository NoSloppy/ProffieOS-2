Nov28 - fine

Dec2 - fine

Dec4 - fine

Dec4pt2 - fine

Dec5 - fine

Dec11 - static_assert(sizeof(T) < 4, "Atomic must be 32 bits or less."); no compile - trying fix as of 13th
Applied fixes from 

Dec13 - all weird audio. delay when next / prev preset. Also shows next font playing, but same font.wav sound played no matter which preset.
Then no sound while still showing sounds playing....stopped accepting commands. just kept playing sounds but no actual output.
powercycled, then also doing next preset played in.wav, no further audio output, but still showing sounds playing. However, truncated messages, as in normal shows 
`unit = 4 vol = 0.50, Playing aa_NoSloppy/Crushed/in/in01.wav`
but these were just `Playing aa_NoSloppy/Crushed/swingh/swingh04.wav` no unit no volume.

Dec16 -  fix stop : audio underflows start here
